# Overview

This software is meant to facilitate the creation of accounts that store notes as text files. While the software technically secures notes through requiring the account password and note title,
anyone with access to the text files could read them outside of the program.

I created this software to become more familiar with Java and specifically to lean how to read and write information
to files using java.
